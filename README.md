# Rule Set 5E Plugin

This unofficial TaleSpire plugin for implementing some D&D 5E rule automation. The base code was written by Lord Ashes with
all of the version 2.0.0 updates done by XJ_Nekomancer.

Currently provides:

1. Four different modes of rolling: Manual on board, manual on the side, automated dice with dice cam, randomly generated
   dice values. Rolling style can be set on a player by player basis using the R2ModMan configuration for this plugin.

2. Three levels of player information in Chat using using unique messages. GM gets full information, attacker and victim
   get detailed infromation about their parts of the exchange and other players get minimal information.

3. Automated attack macros which roll attacks, compare them to target AC or attacker DC, roll damage, apply critial hits, immunities, vulnerabilities and resistances, and adjusts the target HP by the resulting amount.

4. Automated saves and skill roll.

5. Automated healing roll.

6. Roll with Advantage or Disadvantage using a toggle in the menu bar.

7. Roll with Attack Bonus (e.g. Bless), Damage Bonus (e.g. Hex), Healing Bonus (e.g Magical Inspiration) or Skill Bonus (e.g. Guidance)

8. Reaction pause with options to continue, cancel, forced hit, forced critical hit, halve and forced miss.

```
"NPC" indicates a mini is considered an ally (npc=false) or foe (npc=true). It should be noted that a better name for
      this property would have been foe but for backwards compatibility the name will not be changed. If an NPC is not
	  hostile, its NPC value should be false (not true). This will prevent it from giving allies disadvantage in combat
	  if it is adjactent and the ally is using a ranged attack.

"ac" sets the Armor Class.

"reach" indicated the number of feet that the character can make melee attacks and threaten locations from.

"attacks" is an array of Roll objects which define possible attacks the user can make.

"attacksDC" is an array of Roll objects which define possible DC attacks the user can make.

"name" is a Roll object that determines the name of the attack whch will be displayed in the radial menu.
"type" is a Roll obejct that determines the type of attack typically unarmed, melee, range and magic.
       For saves and skills it determine how the results are shared using the following options:
	     Public - Everyone sees the speech bubble and chat message with results. Owner and GM sees breakdown.
		 Private - Everyone sees the speech bubble and chat message of the skill used but not the result.
		           Onwer and GM get results with breakdown. 
		 Secret - No speech bubble or chat message to everyone. Owner and GM sees breakdown.
		 Private, GM - Everyone sees the speech bubble and chat message of the skill used but not the result.
		               Only GM gets results with breakdown.
		 Secret, GM - No speech bubble or chat message to everyone. Only GM sees results with breakdown.
"roll" is a Roll object that determines the roll that is made when this attack is selected. Uses the #D#+# or #D#-# format.
       It should be noted that the number before D is not optional. For example, 1D20 cannot be abbreviated with D20. Also can 
       use "100" value to carry out attacks with guaranteed success.
"range" indicates the end of short range and maximum distance separated by a slash. Used for range and mele attack. For melee
        attacks this value is ignored and the reach value is used if range not exist.
"info" is a optional string parameter that determines extra information for the roll. For attacks, this holds the name of
       the animation that is to be played. If not specified for attack, the attack type is used to determine the animation.

"critrangemin" is the value from which the attack roll is considered a critical hit. (e.g. Improved Critical, 19-20)

"critmultip" is the multiplier of the amount of damage dice that are rolled on a critical hit. (e.g. Brutal Critical, x3 damage rolls on critical)

"link" is a Roll object links to the Roll damage object. This follows the same rules as a Roll object except the type
       determines the damage type and the roll rolls the weapon damage. The link in a Roll damage object can be used
	   to add additional damage (of the same or different type). This is typically used for things like a sword of flame
	   (where the weapon damage type and the bonus damage type are different) or to add extra damage like sneak damage.

"skills" is a Roll object that determines the skill to be rolled and how the results are displayed. The name proeprty
         indicates the name of the skill and is used in the output results. Type is one of "public", "private" (or "owner")
		 or "secret" (or "GM"). Public rolls are displayed as speech bubbles and chat messages for everyone to see.
		 Private rolls appear on a message board that is displayed only for the owner of the mini and the GM. The contents
		 is displayed for a configurable amount of time on the message board but can be dismissed by clicking on the message
		 board. Secret rolls also show up on the message board but only for the GM. The roll property is used to determines
		 the dice and modifier used to make the skill check. If the roll is empty, the roll name will be displayed as a
		 comment. The link property can be used to link to additions rolls which are automatically processed. The link
		 property for skills is typically used to display a comment for the public but display the roll results for the
		 owner and/or GM.
		 
"healing" is a Roll object that determines how much the victim is healed. Uses hierarchy rolls like damage on attack rolls.
          Healing rolls are always pubic and enumerate the different sources of damage and well as the total.

"immunity" is a list of strings representing damage types from which the user takes no damage. When the damage type
           of an attack against the user matches an immunity (exactly) the damage is reduced to 0.
		   
"resistance" is a list of strings representing damage types from which the user takes 1/2 damage. When the damage type
           of an attack against the user matches a resistance (exactly) the damage is reduced to 1/2.
				
"vulnerability" is a list of strings representing damage types from which the user takes 2x damage. When the damage type
           of an attack against the user matches a vulnerability (exactly) the damage is doubled.

Note: Immunity, vulnerability and resistance is only applied to the portion of damage that matches the damage type. If an attack does
      multiple types of damage, the plugin will correctly apply immunity, vulnerability and resistance to only the mathcing damage type.

Note(2):Other fields are optional and can be used to automatically assign stats to your minis according to the "name stats" you have configured in Talespire.
```
### DC Attacks

The Roll field should have 3 values splited by "/"
- First value refers to DC of attack
- Second value refers to the first three characters of the stat saving throw (e.g. CON for constitution saving throw)
- The third value refers to damage received if the saving throw is not successful. Take values "half" if damage half reduced on a failure saving throw or "zero" if no damage.
Moreover the roll field can be set as ["roll":"100"] to carry out attacks with guaranteed success (Secure Success) (e.g. Magic Missile)
	  	  
## Limitations

```
1. While the plugin does expose the characters dictionary (so other plugins can modify it) this plugin reads the contents
   of the Dnd5E files at start up and does not provide any interactive methods to change the settings. For example, a new
   resistance gained through a spell would not be reflected.    
2. The attack sequence does not provide an option for reactions to be used to modify the attack sequence. For example,
   if the user casts a Shield spell to temporarily increase AC or uses a effects of a Warding Flare.
3. Currently does not support damage reduction such as that given by the Heavy Armor Master feat.
4. Advantage and disadvantage rolls are more likely to cause dice to roll out of dice cam view.
5. Scale of 5' is assumed.
6. Saves currently use the Skill Bonus toggle and amount as opposed to the Attack Bonus toggle and amount.
```

### Work-Around: Changing Specifications

Sometimes a character will frequently change its statistics which affect attacks. For example, a Barbarian gains resistance
to physical attacks when raging but not when he/she is not raging. Since the plugin does not provide an interactive way to
change a charcters specifications (inclduing resistance) while running it may seem that such a character design is not
supported. However, there are a couple work arounds to get such characters working with this plugin.

### Damage Changes

Changes to damage such as a rogue attack with and without sneak or barbarian adding damage from rage or not can be solved
by making two (or more) attack entries and using the appropriate one. This fills up the radial menu quickly if you have
many combinations but allows such a character to be used with this plugin.

### Immunity And Resistance Changes

To create a character that can change immunities and/or resistances, such as a barbarian, create two copies of the same
character with slightly different names. For example, "Garth" and "Garth (Rage)". Set the appropriated immunities and
resistances for version. In game, one can switch between the different modes by renaming the character. Since the plugin
looks up the character sheet associated with the mini name, it is possible to access multiple version of a character just
by renaming the character.

## Tips

- You can use reactions to solve many situations: Ignore the attack roll and decide if it's "hit", "critical", "miss" or "halve".
- You can create invisible creatures to deal extra damage. Using DC attacks or Attacks with secure success (Roll:"100").
- You can use DC attacks to simulate traps, including the DC and the damage of the trap.
- You can use DC attacks without damage to determine if a condition or other effects are set on the victim. (The chat will show: "No  damage".)
- So that the way to measure distances between characters are the same for all players, them should have snap to grid enabled or disabled at the same time. 
- There are monsters that are resistant to non-magical piercing, slashing, and/or bludgeoning damage. If the weapon which you are going to attack them is magical and deals one of these damages, you can add "magic" in front of the damage type in order to deals the total damage instead halve damage (e.g. "type" = "magic piercing").

## Others

### Customize Icons

You can also customize the icons of the saving throws and skills. For the skills you must use an icon with its name and png extension (e.g. Survival.png). If the icon is for a saving throw, in addition it must have save_ as a prefix (e.g. save_CON.png). All image files must be in a folder within CustomData with the following name: org.lordashes.plugins.ruleset5e. (e.g. /CustomData/Images/Icons/org.lordashes.plugins.ruleset5e/save_DEX.png)
